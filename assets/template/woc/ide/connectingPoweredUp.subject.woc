@section Connecting your Powered Up devices
@keyword connecting
You can connect and control up to 8 Powered Up Hubs to Wheel.


When you start connecting you should make sure that the device you're connecting to is actually on.
It's possible to connect to a device which isn't turned on, if that happens then the device will
show up in the simulator but isn't working properly. To avoid this from happening you can press the green button
on the device -which makes the light blink- before setting up a connection.


The order in which you connect your devices will determine the layer number, the first connection you setup
will connnect to the first layer, the second to the second, etc.


If you create a program to control multiple Powered Up devices you probably always want the connect them in the same order.

@section Firmware update
Wheel can not update the firmware of your Powered Up devices, if you encounter problems connecting then try updating the
firmware by connecting your device with to the official LegoÂ® app.


@section Connect before running
If you connect your device while your program is already running then the program will not automatically start using the
connected device. The connection has to be setup before you start running your program else the IDE will use modules which
simulate device behaviour.
